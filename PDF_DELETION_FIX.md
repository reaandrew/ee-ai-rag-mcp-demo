# PDF Deletion Fix

## Issue
The Lambda function was reporting PDF deletion in the logs, but the files were still present in the S3 bucket.

## Root Cause Analysis
Several potential issues were identified:

1. **Region Configuration**: The S3 client was initialized with a hardcoded region, which might not match the actual runtime region.

2. **Error Handling**: The PDF deletion code didn't have robust error handling to detect when deletion failed.

3. **Verification**: There was no verification step to confirm that deletion actually happened.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Region Handling
- Modified the Lambda to use the AWS_REGION environment variable provided by the Lambda runtime
- Added a fallback for testing environments

```python
# Before
default_region = "eu-west-2"  
s3_client = boto3.client("s3", region_name=default_region)

# After
region = os.environ.get("AWS_REGION", "eu-west-2")
logger.info(f"Using AWS region: {region}")
s3_client = boto3.client("s3", region_name=region)
```

### 2. Added Robust Error Handling
- Added try/except blocks around the delete operation
- Implemented detailed logging for delete operations

### 3. Added Verification
- Added a verification step that checks if the file still exists after deletion
- Updates the result metadata with the actual deletion status

```python
try:
    s3_client.head_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
    logger.warning(f"PDF file still exists after deletion attempt")
    original_deleted = False
except Exception as head_error:
    if 'Not Found' in str(head_error) or '404' in str(head_error):
        logger.info(f"Verified deletion - PDF no longer exists")
        original_deleted = True
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Error checking if PDF was deleted")
        original_deleted = False
```

## Testing
- Updated unit tests to accommodate the new verification behavior
- Ensured all tests pass with the new changes

## Deployment Instructions
1. Deploy the updated Lambda function
2. Monitor CloudWatch logs to verify deletion is working properly
3. If issues persist, examine the "Delete API response" and verification logs for clues
